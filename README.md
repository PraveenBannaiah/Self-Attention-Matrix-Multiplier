# Transformer-Based Matrix Multiplier (Verilog)

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a matrix multiplier in **Verilog**, targeted toward accelerating Transformer workloads such as attention computations.

## Project Description
- Developed a hardware matrix multiplication module used in Transformer operations.
- Implemented logic for efficient reading of input matrices from a **pre-loaded SRAM**.
- Designed a controlled dataflow mechanism to compute results and store them into an **output SRAM**.
- Emphasis was placed on minimizing memory access overhead and improving throughput.

## Key Features
- Verilog-based RTL implementation
- Structured SRAM read/write control
- Sequential and pipelined data movement
- Scalable design suitable for attention-style matrix operations
